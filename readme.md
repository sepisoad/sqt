# SEPI'D QUAKE TOOLS (SQT)

![logo](docs/sqt.png)

SQT is a set of commands to work with quake 1 files.

The code is licensed under GNU general public license version 3 (GPLv3)

# How to build
The build commands need some refinement, but the code itself is easy to compile and fully portable. My priority is to get the code into the desired state first, after which I’ll update the Makefile to streamline the build process.

# How to use

SQT comes with a lot of sub commands to work with various quake files.

items marked as ✅ are already implemented.

* this command automatically encodes a non-indexed PNG file into a lump file, converting its colors to the standard Quake palette using an approximation technique. No additional steps are required from the user, bellow is an example of the indexd version of the SQT png logo:
